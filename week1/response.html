                The tone this paper from the very start very much conveyed the authors deep desire to reorient a large powerful audience. 
                He implores scientists to reconnect with the essence of scientific development in order to reignite and motivate their 
                innovative energy. He recognizes the ways in which war has driven scientific development and has been the sole inspiration 
                certain scientists, leaving them uninspired when peace arrives. His new vision for scientists is achieved by reminding the 
                reader of the fundamental drive behind science and development; creating an ever-growing source of knowledge for all to 
                benefit from and build upon. However, he also notes the ways in which science, with time, has somewhat grown very burdensome 
                and tedious. Our exponential growth within science has prompted a new era of specialization and expertise in order for us to 
                be truly capable of harnessing humanity’s production of knowledge. He also laments the way in which the complexity of certain 
                scientific instruments or findings makes it difficult of us to apply them in a beneficial manner which renders them 
                unreliable despite their ingenuity.

                Today, this problem has been minimized by reducing production costs but still remains an 
                interesting concept to study. I personally really enjoyed the description he gave of a ‘futuristic’ camera. I admire his 
                awareness of the nuances involved in taking a photography, and the way in which he breaks it down in order to fantasize of a 
                more ideal way of taking photographs that can optimize record-keeping. The vision he creates is compelling and impactful. He 
                also details the aspects of recording knowledge/data that make it either a repetitive and mechanized task vs. a task that 
                requires rational processing or data manipulation, for which it has been notoriously difficult to automate. He highlights 
                the importance of the two working together- the mechanism and the working mind that skillfully employs it.

                Therefore, it just as important to fine-tune the process of analyzing recorded data then merely optimizing its collection 
                and storage. He thus urges the reader to comprehend and capitalize on the genius of the human mind and the ways in which it 
                made not be artificially replicated. The example of the “memex” is also very intricate and thought-provoking method of 
                record-keeping that encourages a effective form factor for harnessing humanity’s wisdom.
