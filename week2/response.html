                    A lot more is possible, only if art is striped of the false mystery and the false religiosity which surrounds it. 
                    This religiosity, usually linked with cash value but alway but always invoked in the name of culture and civilization, 
                    is in fact a substitute for what paintings lost when the camera made them reproducible”

            <p style="font-size: 28px; padding: 15px;">
                I'd love to quote the entire episode but these were the lines that stood out to me most. 
                I also really appreciated how half the episode is a panel of women of different ages was brought in to 
                discuss the topic for themselves. I was surprised by how valuable art is for reflecting on how women are 
                perceived by men/perceive themselves.

                    A nude has to be seen as an object in order to be a nude.”

                In this episode, I especially enjoyed the paintings he chose to analyze. Specifically,
                I enjoyed the last painting of a women weighing gold on scales. His persepective made the
                scene so much richer and I felt an appreciation for the nuances in the technique.
